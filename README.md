#Neural Network Classifier with Hyperparameter Tuning and K-Fold Cross-Validation

This project demonstrates how to build and optimize a neural network classifier using Keras and scikit-learn. We employ hyperparameter tuning with grid search and k-fold cross-validation to enhance model performance. The final model is trained on the entire dataset using the best hyperparameters identified during the tuning process.

Overview
Model Architecture: Defined using Keras Sequential API.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Performed using GridSearchCV from scikit-learn.
Cross-Validation: Utilized K-fold cross-validation to ensure robust model evaluation.
Visualization: Plotted training and validation accuracy for each fold to monitor performance.






Results
Average Test Accuracy: Achieved high average test accuracy through k-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
Best Hyperparameters: Identified optimal hyperparameters for model training.
Visualization: Plotted training and validation accuracy for each fold to monitor performance.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates an effective approach to building and optimizing a neural network classifier using hyperparameter tuning and k-fold cross-validation. By systematically searching through a range of hyperparameters and leveraging cross-validation, we achieve robust and reliable model performance.
